# Neural-Network-Design-with-NLP
A user-friendly system that uses NLP and AutoKeras to automatically generate neural network architectures from natural language input. It leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to build optimized deep learning models for tasks like image/text classification, time series forecasting, regression, and sentiment analysis.
