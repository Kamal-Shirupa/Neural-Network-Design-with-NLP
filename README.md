# Neural Network Design With NLP

This project enables users to generate neural network architectures by providing model requirements in natural language. It supports multiple machine learning tasks (text, image, regression, and more) and delivers multilingual model summaries, leveraging a modular, maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Natural language-driven model generation** for a variety of ML tasks
- **Multilingual support** for model summaries and documentation
- **Well-organized, modular source code** for maintainability and extensibility
- **Configuration via separate config files** for default parameters and supported languages
- **Comprehensive samples and demo notebooks** to facilitate reproducibility

## Requirements

Install all necessary dependencies with:

```
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

Core dependencies include:
- `tensorflow` (deep learning framework)
- `autokeras` (automated model building)
- `googletrans` (translation services)

## Usage

Run the application from the command line:

```
python src/main.py
```

Follow prompts to enter your model description and language preference.

For an interactive walkthrough, open the provided Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook notebooks/demo_run.ipynb
```

## Example

**Sample Input:**
```
10 layers, GRU, dropout 0.3, 5 output classes, channels 4
```

**Sample Outputs:**
- Multilingual model summaries and architecture details are available in `samples/outputs/`.

## Configuration

Default parameters and supported language codes are configurable in the `config/` directory.
